        <h2>Here's a time line of Tesla's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>On July 10th 1856, Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia)</li>
          <li>In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium</li>
          <li>He became interested in electricity by his physics professor. Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this "mysterious phenomena" made him want "to know more of this wonderful force". Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating. He completed a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873</li>
          <li>After graduating Tesla returned home but soon contracted cholera, he was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. In a moment of despair, Tesla's father promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.</li>
          <li>He began studying electrical engineering and enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz in 1875 on a Military Frontier scholarship, but by his third year he was failing in school</li>
          <li>Professors at the university warned Tesla's father that the young scholar's working and sleeping habits were killing him. But rather than finish his studies, Tesla became a gambling addict, lost all his tuition money, dropped out of school and suffered a nervous breakdown.</li>
          <li>He left Graz in December 1878</li>
          <li>In 1881, after recovering from his breakdown, Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Within a few months, Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position </li>
          <li>In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a citizen</li>
          <li>After arrving in New York, he was hired as an engineer at Thomas Edison’s Manhattan headquarters.</li>
          <li>He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he left on his own ventures</li>
          <li>With help from his financial partners, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices</li>
          <li>In 1888, he had patents in alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC, licensed by Westinghouse Electric</li>
          <li>His AC inventions became the cornerstone of the polyphase system and are still used around the world today</li>
          <li>Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments</li>
          <li>In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices.</li>
          <li>In 1898, he built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever exhibited</li>
          <li>In 1901, Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter</li>
          <li>Tesla intended to transmit messages, telephony and even facsimile images across the Atlantic to England and to ships at sea based on his theories of using the Earth to conduct the signals. </li>
          <li>Additional investment could not be found, and the project was abandoned in 1906, never to become operational.</li>
          <li>After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success</li>
          <li>Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.</li>
          <li>Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor</li>
        </ul>

          <p>“Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born.”</p>
          <p>“My brain is only a receiver, in the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration. I have not penetrated into the secrets of this core, but I know that it exists.”</p>
          <p>
  “If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.” </p>
          <p>
  “The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.” </p>
